# Scientific Writing  Principles

* Research is the gathering of peer-reviewed evidence to support a scientific writing.

* Peer Review means to read or check and give your opinion about scientific contents written by another scientist or expert working  in the same domain field of interest as you.

* Scientific writing follows certain conventions related to format, citation, design, voice,
tense, concision and organization that may differ from writing in other contexts. The best
way to learn these conventions is to read representative samples (published or
conference papers) within each discipline. 

Although every audience—be it a peer-reviewed
journal, professional organization, or academic search committee—has unique
expectations and demands, the following advice applies to most scientific writing.



## 1. Present and organize information in the correct format
Readers expect information in a certain order under specified headings
* Most article manuscripts and theses follow the IMRaD format
    * Introduction, Methodology, Results and Discussion
    * Some documents contain a Literature Review after the Introduction

 

## 2. Use the correct citation style
* IEEE Referencing Style

## 3. Use direct quotations sparingly
* Paraphrasing demonstrates comprehension of source material and the ability to
concisely synthesize it with one’s own ideas
* Direct quotations should only be used when meaning might be lost by
paraphrasing the original author’s words

## 4. Use tables, graphs and other visuals to illustrate information
* Visual aids can sometimes illustrate information more clearly than sentences and
paragraphs
* Each citation style has its own conventions for labeling and referencing visual
aids

## 5. Write in active voice unless passive voice is necessary
Active voice is generally more effective in scientific writing
* It is direct and clear
* It demonstrates agency

Passive voice is sometimes preferable
* When the action itself is more important than who performed the action
    * In methodology sections, for instance, passive voice removes the agent
and makes the experimental process the subject of the sentence


In the following example, active voice is preferable because it may be important to know
who drew or what determined the conclusion:

* Passive Voice: It was concluded that the river is contaminated.
* Active Voice: Researchers concluded that the river is contaminated.

Results demonstrate that the river is contaminated.
In the next example, passive voice is preferred because the action is more important
than who performed the action.

* Active Voice: We observed cell division in the sample.
* Passive Voice: Cell division was observed in the sample.


## 6. Write in the proper tense:
Use past tense for actions performed in the past, including primary and secondary
research/source material and most methodology descriptions
* Jones et al. `discussed` a small yet significant difference…
* Mothers `were interviewed` in early and late pregnancy…

Use present tense for statements of fact, general truths, and conditions that are
continuously true. When writing about others’ completed research or published findings,
generally use past tense; however, if the views of a current researcher are well known
and commonly accepted as fact, present tense may be preferred.

* Researchers `recognize` that folic acid supplements are a potent source of methyl
donors, which can `induce` epigenetic changes by altering…
Use present perfect tense to describe action or research that occurred in the past but
that is ongoing or connected to the present.
* No previous study `has` reported the simultaneous effect of…


## 7. Eliminating Redundancy
Scientific writing requires a writer to convey complex information directly and concisely.
Add all the detail needed to convey the idea, but leave out extraneous information.
Write concisely and omit redundancy by:
* Using precise action verbs
* Avoiding hedging verbs such as appear and seem
* Limiting the use of prepositional phrases
* Avoiding useless qualifiers such as perhaps, very, quite, several, essentially,
basically, always and actually

Example:
* Wordy: In the first trial conducted in this experiment, there appears to be a
demonstration of the effects when the substances are combined into one.
* Concise: The first trial demonstrated the negative effects of combining the substances

Note that the prepositional phrases “in the first trial” and “in this experiment” have been
eliminated, and “the first trial” becomes the subject of the sentence. The revised
sentence avoids the hedging verb “appear” in favor of the more active “demonstrated,”
and since “combined” implies that two things become one, the phrase “into one” is
omitted. “The negative effects” becomes the object of the sentence, leaving only one
prepositional phrase at the end: “of combining the substances.”

## 8. Make sentences simple and active
In an effort to sound objective and technical, writers in the sciences often
overcomplicate their explanations with nominalizations. However, this should be
avoided because scientific concepts are already complex and can easily be obfuscated.
Because verbs are the strongest, most active component of a sentence, such confusion
often stems from the nominalization of verbs. This occurs when the verb becomes a
noun, which buries the action and weakens the verb. Consequently, the sentence
becomes more difficult to understand. 

An example of this is:
* Nominalization: An `analysis` of the prefrontal cortex shows the patient’s inadequate
emotional and behavioral `regulation`.

* Revision with Active Verb: The researchers `analyzed` the patient’s prefrontal cortex and
found that he inadequately `regulated` his emotions and behavior.

In the first example, the subject is “analysis,” but this could easily function as a stronger
action verb: “analyze.” Changing “analysis” from a noun to a verb allows for a clearer
subject: “the researchers.” By changing “regulation” to a verb, it is easier to identify the
phenomenon the researchers observed in the patient: that he “inadequately regulated
his emotions and behavior.

## 9. Build arguments by connecting sentences:
In scientific writing, it is important to recognize that you are still making an argument,
whether you’re synthesizing previous research, arguing for a new method, or making a
case for the validity of your own conclusions. Making these arguments is easier when
your sentences connect and build off each other. Since readers focus on concepts at
the end of sentences, it is important to begin subsequent sentences by building on the
preceding idea and enacting the idea of end focus. It is helpful to think about this
concept in terms of known information and new information. Experienced writers begin
sentences with information that is already known or has previously been introduced;
they utilize end focus by concluding sentences with new information because this is
where the reader typically expects novel and important information. Following this pattern forges a clear connection between sentences and provides readers with a
logical progression of ideas.

* Unclear: `Intramembranous bones`, in the cranium, are ossified from
membranes transformed from mesenchymal tissues. The cranial vault, facial
bones, the mandible, and the clavicle are `intramembranous bones`.
    * These sentences are disjointed. The old information in the second sentence
is placed in the stress position (at the end of the sentence), and the new
information is placed at the beginning of the sentence, in the topic position.
As a result, the sentences are not coherent.

* Clear: Some areas of the cranium are ossified from membranes transformed
from mesenchymal tissues and are `called intramembranous bones`. `These
bones` include the cranial vault, facial bones, the mandible, and the clavicle.
    * These sentences are coherent because the old information is placed at the
beginning of the second sentence and the new information is placed at the
end (the stress position). The new information in the first sentence becomes
the old information in the second, which helps the reader follow the ideas
being presented.

## 10. Avoid subject-verb separation whenever possible:
Because scientific writing often builds off other concepts and theories across fields, it is
particularly useful to keep the subject and verb close together to make it easier for
layreaders to follow. Keeping subjects and their verbs connected (especially in longer
sentences) ensures that readers don’t forget who or what is performing the action:

* Unclear: `DNA`, found in body fluids (blood, saliva, urine, and semen), soft tissues,
bone, teeth, nails, hair roots (nuclear DNA), and hair shafts (mitochondrial DNA),
contains genetic code.

* Clear: `DNA contains` genetic code and is found in body fluids (blood, saliva,
urine, and semen), soft tissues, bone, teeth, nails, hair roots (nuclear DNA), and
hair shafts (mitochondrial DNA).


In this example, the revision is much easier to follow because the reader is immediately
able to identify what the subject is (DNA) and what the author wants to say about it (that
it contains genetic code and where it is found in the body). Consequently, the reader is
not bogged down in an extensive list of examples before understanding what the author
aims to convey.
