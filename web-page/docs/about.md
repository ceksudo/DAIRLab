# About Resolution AI

Resolution is a Responsible Open Lab Uniting Talented Individuals Online

# Guidlines on Slack 


- I will encourage everyone to introduce yourselves in the `#introductions channel`. You might find individuals who have similar interests and can start collaborating or even becoming friends. Networking is a really important skill and something we are trying to learn at Resolution is how to grow as an individual and we should start from small things which is how to connect with people, how to grow our network, and how to find people which can help us grow together, so please join that channel if you have not yet and start connecting with each other. Again we are a one big family here and we want everyone to know everyone else



- If you encounter any interesting papers that you want to share with your friends feel free to do so in the `#ai-research channel`.

- If you have an idea and are looking for collaborators feel free to share the high levels of it in the same channel `#ai-research` and try to find collaborators who are also interested in working in the same space. (E.g., Hi everyone, I have an idea and want to work on AI fairness in text to image domain, if anyone is interested in joining please reach out. I need people who have this and that expertise something like that...)


- If you have a talk or a defense or a thesis proposal coming up and you want to do practice talks feel free to announce them in the social and invite us. We can join and give you feedback.

- If you have an upcoming interview and are looking for some guidance feel free to share and ask help from your fellow friends.


- If you have an awesome finding that you want to share, you can ping me and we can schedule a talk session for you. You can also put it in your resume that you gave a talk at Resolution maybe?


- If you are attending a conference and are wondering if any of your friends are also attending the same conference feel free to announce them in the social and see if you can have a gathering during the conference.


- We can start monthly reading sessions across everyone who is a member here where each time a group of one or two + people can join efforts to create couple of slides about a paper and we read and discuss some ideas together.

- We will also try to have some fun social gatherings in the future.

- If you have any comments/suggestions on what we can do to help you please do not hesitate to reach out to our adviser.
